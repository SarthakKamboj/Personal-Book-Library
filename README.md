This project was meant to create a personal library of books that someone wants to read or has read. It required the use of several aspects of Javascript, primarily the heavy use of EventListeners, DOM manipulation, and local storage.

The EventListeners were used to add functionality to the buttons and allow information to be stored locally. They were also used to remove certain books from local storage, ensuring a dynamic experience.

I also used DOM manipulation primarily to add books to this personal library. Accessing certain HTML elements, adding and removing classes, and taking advantage of the HTML lineage helped me solidy my understanding of DOM elements and their relationships.

Lastly, I used local storage to store information of the books locally. This allowed me to access them across different HTML files and taught me how to access, remove, and manipulate the information stored within the browser's storage.
